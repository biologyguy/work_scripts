Welcome to Steve's folder-o-joy
===============================
The work script Repo
--------------------

#### seq_tools
Collection of scripts to manipuate DNA and/or protein sequences.

#### phylo_tools
Collection of phylogenetic scripts.

#### utilities
Programs for doing stuff on the cammand line (like timer.py and renaming.py), or collections of phython
functions (MyFuncs.py).

#### workshop
Anything under very early development belongs in here. The test_files directory is ignored by GIT, so feel free to fill 
it up with junk.

#### junkyard
This is where one-off, or less-flexible scripts go. If they get re-purposed, maybe they can one day make it into one of
the more prestigious directories

#### cemetery
This is were old code is laid to rest, with the expectation that if it gets deleted, it's no big deal. Nice to keep 
the bones of discarded programs around though, in case they can be retooled one day.

#### ancestral_recon
These are some scripts I was using for my previous project, trying to compare Innexins and Connexins
