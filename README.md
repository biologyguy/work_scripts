Welcome to Steve's folder-o-joy
===============================
The work script Repo
--------------------

#### seq_tools
Collection of scripts used to manipuate DNA and/or protein sequences. The primary program is seqBuddy.py, the flagship 
tool in the Buddy Suite.

#### phylo_tools
Collection of scripts that most wrap or use Bio.Phylo. phyloBuddy.py is part of the Buddy Suite

#### utilities
Programs for doing useful stuff on the cammand line (like timer.py and renaming.py), or collections of useful phython
functions (MyFuncs.py).

#### workshop
Anything under very early development belongs in here. The test_files directory is ignored by GIT, so feel free to fill 
it up with junk.

#### junkyard
This is where one-off, or less-flexible scripts go. If they get repurposed, maybe they can one day make it into one of
the more prestigious directories

#### cemetary
This is were old code is layed to rest, with the expectation that if it get's deleted, it's no big deal. Nice to keep 
the bones of discarded programs around though, in case they can be retooled one day.
